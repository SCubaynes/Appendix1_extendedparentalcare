# Appendix1_extendedparentalcare

This repertory corresponds to the Appendix 1 of the article entitled "Modeling the demography of species providing extended parental care: 
A capture-recapture multievent model with a case study on Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus)"
by authors Sarah Cubaynes, Jon Aars, Nigel G. Yoccoz, Roger Pradel, Ã˜ystein Wiig, Rolf A Ims and Olivier Gimenez

This repertory contains all the files necessary to simulate the data and fit the model to simulated dataset.

Detailed instructions are provided in Appendix1_Simulatedata_Fitsimulateddata.Rmd (or the pdf version).
You can simulate the data yourself following these instructions. 
Alternatively, if you want to avoid this step, you can unzip the simulated data provided in simulateddata.zip in the same directory than the Appendix1_Simulatedata_Fitsimulateddata.Rmd.
